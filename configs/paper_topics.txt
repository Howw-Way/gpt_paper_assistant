**1. Proposing New Methodological Advances for PDE Solvers Enhanced by Machine Learning**  
   - **Relevant:** Papers that introduce innovative methods for solving partial differential equations using machine learning. This includes approaches that combine neural networks with classical numerical techniques, hybrid frameworks that integrate adaptive meshing or error estimation via ML, or differentiable PDE solvers designed for end-to-end optimization.  
   - **Not relevant:** Works that merely apply standard ML models to benchmark PDE problems without offering any new methodological insights or integration with traditional PDE theory.

**2. Advancements in ODE Integration and Approximation through ML Techniques**  
   - **Relevant:** Research that develops novel approaches for solving or approximating ordinary differential equations with machine learning. Look for papers that present new neural-network-based solvers, methods that learn dynamical system representations, or techniques that embed ODE solvers in differentiable programming frameworks.  
   - **Not relevant:** Studies that use off-the-shelf ML algorithms for time-series prediction without addressing the underlying ODE structure or offering improvements over existing solvers.

**3. Breakthroughs in Fluid Simulation and CFD Accelerated by Machine Learning**  
   - **Relevant:** Papers focusing on integrating ML with fluid simulation or computational fluid dynamics. Examples include using neural networks for turbulence modeling, hybrid CFD solvers that incorporate learned components for speed or accuracy, and methods that use ML to guide mesh refinement or parameter tuning in simulations.  
   - **Not relevant:** Works that concentrate solely on traditional CFD techniques or that apply ML in a superficial manner without developing new simulation methodologies.

**4. Development and Application of Differentiable Solvers and Hybrid Numerical Methods**  
   - **Relevant:** Research introducing differentiable programming techniques into numerical solvers, allowing gradient-based optimization and end-to-end training. This category also covers hybrid methods that combine classical simulation with learning-based components, providing a new paradigm for solver design.  
   - **Not relevant:** Papers that discuss differentiable programming or hybrid methods only in passing, or that donâ€™t integrate these ideas into novel numerical algorithms.

**5. Rigorous Comparative Studies and Performance Analyses of ML-Driven Numerical Methods**  
   - **Relevant:** Works that not only propose new hybrid or ML-based solvers but also perform detailed theoretical or empirical evaluations against conventional methods. Key aspects include analyses of convergence, stability, computational efficiency, and performance on challenging benchmarks.  
   - **Not relevant:** Papers that offer only superficial performance comparisons or focus solely on specific application domains without general methodological contributions.
